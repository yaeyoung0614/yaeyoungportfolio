            <strong>Context</strong>
            <h3>Saving is a long game—and often a quiet one.</h3>
            <p>
              Most savings tools emphasize the end result: a number, a
              threshold, a completed bar. For users trying to build healthy
              financial habits, the challenge isn't just how to save, but how to
              stay with it. Numbers alone rarely sustain motivation. What's
              needed is a way to make progress feel real—even when the finish
              line is far away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Centible wanted to introduce a new savings feature that respected
              this emotional journey. It had to feel simple, but thoughtful.
              Lightweight, but persistent. A feature designed not for perfect
              savers, but for committed ones.
            </p>
            <strong>Goal</strong>
            <p>Create a savings goal experience that helps users:</p>
            <p>
              1. Set intentional financial goals (vacations, emergency funds,
              large purchases) <br />
              2. Track and visualize progress in a way that feels clear and
              encouraging <br />
              3. Feel emotionally reinforced by their consistency—not just by
              hitting targets
            </p>
            <p>
              It needed to live within the broader Centible ecosystem,
              integrating smoothly into the budgeting flow while offering enough
              autonomy to feel personalized.

          <div class="signals-section-col signals-section-col-left">
            <h2 class="signals-section-title">02. Process</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="signals-section-col signals-section-col-right">
            <h3>1. Setting a Goal</h3>
            <p>
              The flow begins with a simple prompt: What are you saving for?
            </p>
            <p>Users create a goal by:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>Naming it ("Emergency Fund," "Thailand Trip")</li>
              <li>Setting a target amount</li>
              <li>Optionally adding a note</li>
              <li>
                Optionally logging any existing savings as a starting balance
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We intentionally kept this flow minimal. Conversations during
              early design reviews surfaced the need to reduce friction,
              especially for users new to structured saving.
            </p>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              We consolidated "Do you have existing savings?" into the new goal
              flow (instead of a separate screen) to avoid interrupting
              momentum.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Manual vs. Linked Deposits</h3>
            <p>
              Once a goal is created, users update their progress by logging
              deposits—either manually or via linked accounts.
            </p>
            <p>We explored three implementation paths:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Manual input (MVP):</strong> Most direct and flexible;
                users add deposits anytime they save.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Linked savings account via Plaid:</strong> Automatically
                attributes transfers toward goals based on rules. More seamless,
                but higher technical complexity and risk of misattribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Percentage-based automation:</strong> E.g., "10% of any
                deposit goes to savings goals." Simple for users but blurs the
                boundary between spending and saving accounts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              We prioritized manual entry for the initial release. It gave users
              control, required minimal backend complexity, and avoided the
              confusion of automated withdrawals. Smart allocation rules via
              Plaid were logged as a future enhancement.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Visual Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Savings progress is visualized through a clean progress bar or
              percentage wheel. This made progress tangible and satisfying, even
              if the numbers were small.
            </p>
            <p>Each goal screen displays:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>Goal name + editable note</li>
              <li>Target amount + current progress</li>
              <li>Estimated completion time (based on deposit history)</li>
              <li>Deposit log (manual + linked, with dates and amounts)</li>
              <li>
                Optional motivational insights (e.g. "You've saved $200 this
                month!")
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              Progress visualization was designed to feel fluid, not mechanical.
              Completion estimates offer orientation without pressure.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Dashboard + Goal Management</h3>
            <p>Goals live in a consolidated dashboard view, where users can:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>See all active goals at a glance</li>
              <li>
                Toggle to show/hide completed goals (inspired by the iOS
                Reminders app)
              </li>
              <li>Tap into any goal for deeper insights</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We originally considered using category icons for each goal (e.g.
              plane for travel, piggy bank for emergency), but this created
              confusion with spending categories. Instead, we adopted a
              universal icon with color customization, giving users a small
              moment of ownership.
            </p>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              Color-coding let users bring personality to their goals without
              cluttering the UI.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Reinforcement + Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              We wanted users to feel recognized—not in a gamified, high-stakes
              way, but in small, timely moments.
            </p>
            <p>Ideas we explored:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>Milestone badges for reaching 25%, 50%, 100%</li>
              <li>Encouraging notifications tied to deposit behavior</li>
              <li>
                Streaks for regular saving (ultimately scrapped—see below)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              We intentionally removed streaks after user research showed that
              inconsistent savers felt discouraged by them. Instead, we leaned
              into quiet encouragement, like, "You added to your savings again
              this week—nice work."
            </p>
            <p>
              We also decided against implementing recurring savings schedules.
              Users who forgot they turned on automation often felt confused or
              frustrated when money moved unexpectedly.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Location in app:</strong> After discussion, we housed
                Savings Goals under the Budgets tab instead of introducing a new
                one—simplifying navigation and maintaining cohesion with
                financial planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Completion flow:</strong> We debated adding a "Mark Goal
                Complete" CTA, but opted for automatic completion when the goal
                target is met. It reduces friction and avoids unnecessary
                decision-making.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Filtering:</strong> Completed goals are hidden by
                default, but accessible via a toggle. This gives users a sense
                of closure without visual noise.
              </li>

            <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
            <p>
              The design process began with quick sketches to explore different
              layouts and interactions for the savings goals feature. I focused
              on making the experience feel lightweight while maintaining
              clarity.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Moving from sketches to wireframes, I refined the layout and
              interaction patterns. The goal was to create a clear hierarchy
              while keeping the interface minimal and focused.

            <h3>Dashboard + Goal Management</h3>
            <p>Goals live in a consolidated dashboard view, where users can:</p>
            <ul class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>See all active goals at a glance</li>
              <li>
                Toggle to show/hide completed goals (inspired by the iOS
                Reminders app)
              </li>
              <li>Tap into any goal for deeper insights</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We originally considered using Centible's existing category icons
              (e.g., travel, emergency, home), but during testing, these created
              confusion when visually overlapping with spending categories. To
              reduce cognitive load and keep the feature feeling distinct, we
              explored a separate set of icons specifically for savings goals.
              These were designed to be more aspirational and
              symbolic—reflecting goals like "Peace of Mind" or
              "Adventure"—rather than transactional.
            </p>
            <div class="signals-centered-image">
              <img
                src="Images/goal_types_centible.png"
                alt="Icon design exploration"
                style="width: 110%; height: auto"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Ultimately, we decided to adopt a more universal icon with
              optional color customization for the MVP. This provided users with
              a moment of ownership and clarity while keeping the UI clean and
              focused. Custom goal icons remain on our roadmap as a potential
              enhancement for future personalization.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Design System</h3>
            <p>
              The final design system established consistent patterns for the
              savings goals feature, ensuring it felt cohesive with the rest of
              the Centible app while maintaining its unique identity.

                <li>
                  Many savings tools focus on outcomes—how much you’ve
                  saved—without supporting the ongoing experience of saving.
                  This leaves users feeling detached, especially when progress
                  is slow or inconsistent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Automation without clarity often leads to confusion, and
                  features like streaks or rigid deposit schedules can
                  unintentionally discourage users who don’t save regularly.
                </li>

              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem">
                We designed Centible’s savings goals to reframe saving from a
                rigid metric-driven task into a flexible, emotionally resonant
                experience. The solution emphasized clarity, control, and
                consistency over perfection. Key design choices included:

            <h3>App Team Carolina Gala</h3>
            <p>
              At the end of the semester, I had the opportunity to present our
              team's work at the App Team Carolina Gala. It was a rewarding
              experience to showcase our progress and share the story behind
              Centible with peers, mentors, and industry professionals. The
              event highlighted the impact of our project and the value of
              collaborative, student-driven innovation.

            <h3>Reflections on Cross-Functional Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Working on Centible as part of a cross-functional team was a
              transformative experience. Unlike solo projects, collaborating
              with developers and backend engineers required me to think beyond
              just the user interface. I had to consider technical constraints,
              communicate design intent clearly, and adapt my process to fit the
              needs of the entire team.
            </p>
            <p>
              This collaboration pushed me to be more flexible and pragmatic in
              my design decisions. I learned the importance of clear
              documentation, open communication, and iterative feedback.
              Ultimately, working with a diverse team made the final product
              stronger and more user-centered.
            </p>
            <p class="signals-cite">
              🤝 Designing alongside developers and backend engineers taught me
              how to bridge the gap between vision and implementation.
