        <p>
          For this project, I redesigned and built a fully custom website for a
          local screen print shop, The Merch, in Carrboro, NC. Using pure HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, I created a responsive and visually engaging site
          that reflects the shop's unique identity. To ensure consistency with
          their branding, I conducted in-depth research and met with the team in
          person to capture their style and vision. This hands-on approach
          allowed me to create a website that feels authentic to their business
          while providing a user-friendly experience.

          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The primary goal of this project was to create a simple,
            user-friendly website that captured the essence of The Merch’s
            skateboard culture. I focused on delivering a design that reflected
            their brand identity while enhancing usability. Additionally, I
            incorporated their past collaborations with local businesses in
            Chapel Hill and Carrboro to boost their community presence. Through
            research and in-person visits, I ensured the final product aligned
            with their vision and provided an intuitive user experience.

          <h2>The Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The primary goal for this project was to create a modern,
            user-friendly website for The Merch, a local screen printing shop
            based in Carrboro, NC. The website needed to be simple, efficient,
            and aligned with their unique aesthetic and branding. Since their
            target audience isn't using the site for online shopping, but rather
            for gathering information about services, the design had to
            prioritize clarity and ease of navigation. To achieve these goals, I
            focused on two main areas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Complexity: Simplifying the website design, using minimal colors,
              and ensuring the layout was clean and visually appealing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessibility: Streamlining the website's necessary pages in the
              header for quick access, making it easy for users to find
              information in one place.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>User-Centered Design Approach</h2>
          <p>
            One of the key focuses of this project was ensuring that the website
            provided a seamless experience for all users, regardless of the
            device they were using. I ensured the website was:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Responsive: Adaptable for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing,
              with layouts that adjusted to different screen sizes without
              losing functionality or aesthetic appeal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessible: Included features like clear navigation, alt text for
              all images, appropriate contrast ratios, and font sizes that are
              easy to read, ensuring the site is accessible to users with
              disabilities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Client Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            The redesign process involved constant collaboration with The Merch
            team. Through multiple in-person visits and feedback sessions, I was
            able to capture their brand's essence and incorporate their vision
            into the final product. The collaboration included:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Regular design reviews.</li>
            <li>
              Adjustments based on the team’s evolving ideas and feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuous updates to ensure their vision was reflected in the
              site design, both aesthetically and functionally.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Performance Optimizations</h2>
          <p>
            To enhance the website’s performance, I implemented several
            technical optimizations:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Image Compression: Reduced file sizes for faster loading without
              sacrificing image quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clean Code: Used semantic HTML and CSS to ensure a streamlined and
              efficient structure, improving the site’s overall performance and
              maintainability.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
          <p>
            The new website design was built to reflect The Merch’s unique
            identity and their connection to the local skateboard culture in
            Carrboro and Chapel Hill. Here’s how I integrated their branding:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Visual Identity: Created a cohesive color palette and design
              language that reflects the brand's roots. I used a blend of
              industrial and modern aesthetics to capture the spirit of The
              Merch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Showcasing Collaborations: Highlighted their collaborations with
              local businesses, ensuring the site not only represented their
              brand but also their community ties.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>SEO and Discoverability</h2>
          <p>
            While the main objective was to ensure ease of use, I also worked on
            increasing the website's visibility through basic SEO strategies:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Structured Data: Implemented schema markup where appropriate to
              ensure the site appears in local business searches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keywords: Integrated relevant keywords related to The Merch's
              services, such as “screen printing in Carrboro,” to improve the
              site's discoverability by potential clients.
            </li>
          </ul>
