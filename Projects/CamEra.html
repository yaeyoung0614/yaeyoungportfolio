          CamEra is a mobile app I developed using React Native, designed to
          simplify the process of selecting the perfect digital camera. In
          February 2024, I created this app as part of a project focused on
          enhancing the shopping experience for photography enthusiasts. CamEra
          features a user-friendly interface, which I designed in Figma, and
          showcases nine popular compact camera brands, allowing users to
          compare and find the best fit for their needs efficiently.

          <h2>STATEMENT OF WORK</h2>
          <p>
            For my CamEra project, I took full ownership of the development
            process, ensuring a comprehensive approach from concept to delivery.
            My responsibilities included researching the most popular camera
            brands and analyzing their key features, such as picture quality and
            functionality. I designed the appâ€™s interface using Figma to create
            an intuitive user experience, then tested and refined the
            application to ensure it met user needs. The project deliverables
            included user research, a functional app prototype, high-quality
            mockups, and thorough documentation covering the research and
            development stages.

          <h2>THE INSPIRATION</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout the CamEra project, I benefited from extensive resources
            that allowed me to shape a tailored solution for frequent social
            media users, particularly women-identifying individuals. Compact
            cameras have recently surged in popularity, appearing on platforms
            like Etsy and eBay, and I sought to simplify the research process
            for users. By gathering details like camera specifications, battery
            types, photo quality, and release dates, I aimed to create an
            informative and user-friendly experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Infusing the design with a feminine color palette, I wanted to
            appeal to my target audience by using softer, inviting tones. The
            goal was to help users build better spending habits by ensuring they
            make informed decisions and avoid impulsive purchases. This approach
            stands in contrast to a more generic shopping experience, offering
            users personalized recommendations based on thorough research.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was heavily front-end skill-focused, as I built the
            prototype from the ground up using React Native. This involved
            designing efficient component layouts and implementing responsive
            design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across various
            devices. Through this hands-on approach, I gained practical
            knowledge in front-end development, enhancing my ability to bridge
            the gap between design and functionality. Overall, the CamEra
            project was a transformative experience that deepened my
            understanding of user-centered design and the technical skills
            necessary to bring an idea to life.
