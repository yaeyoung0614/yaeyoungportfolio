            <strong>Problem</strong>
            <h3>
              Despite being central to modern communication, read receipts fail
              to reflect the nuance of real human availability—fueling anxiety
              and misinterpretation.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Traditional messaging apps offer only a binary read receipt
              (“Read” or nothing). This fails to reflect real-life
              nuances—people read messages when busy, and intentions get
              misinterpreted.
            </p>
            <strong>Solution</strong>
            <p>
              Signal is a UX concept that rethinks the read receipt—offering
              more than just a timestamp. Instead of sending a quick text, users
              can quietly personalize how their "read" status is perceived,
              using a subtle layer of emotional context.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal was to build a feature that allows users to quickly send
              Signals—short contextual replies like “Will reply soon” or “Busy
              until 5pm”—from the lock screen, reducing anxiety and social
              friction in digital conversations.

            <p>
              In today's messaging culture, being "left on read" can feel
              personal—even when it's not. It often stirs up a lot of different
              emotions when you think you were left on read, and you don't know
              why
            </p>
            <ol class="signals-problem-list">
              <li>"Are they ignoring me?"</li>
              <li>"Did I do something wrong?"</li>
              <li>"Why aren't they replying?"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is a common social UX failure.</p>
            <strong>Why Signals Matter</strong>
            <p>
              Read receipts are inherently binary—either a message is marked as
              seen or it isn't. But real life is far more nuanced. People often
              read messages while they're busy, in meetings, or commuting,
              without the capacity to respond right away. Unfortunately, not
              replying immediately can unintentionally signal disinterest or
              even rudeness, leading to misunderstandings and social friction.

              To understand how people experience read receipts today—and how

                    A significant portion of users experience anxiety when their
                    messages are read but not promptly responded to. This
                    pressure stems from the expectation of immediate
                    communication, leading to discomfort for both senders and
                    receivers.

                    Many users adopt strategies to avoid the implications of
                    read receipts, such as reading messages through
                    notifications or disabling the feature entirely. This
                    indicates a desire for more control over how their message
                    engagement is perceived.

                    This includes options to indicate they have seen a message
                    and will respond later, providing clarity without the
                    pressure of immediate replies.

                    Introducing customizable read receipts can address these
                    concerns by allowing users to send predefined signals
                    indicating their status. This feature can reduce
                    misunderstandings and alleviate the pressure associated with
                    traditional read receipts.

            <h3>Sending signals over</h3>
            <p>
              With a quick tap from the lock screen, users can send a Signal—a
              short, pre-set status like "Will reply soon" or "Busy until 5pm".
              Once sent, this signal seamlessly appears in place of a
              traditional read receipt, giving the message sender valuable
              context without requiring a full reply. It’s a low-effort,
              high-empathy feature that preserves clarity while respecting
              availability.

            <h3>Signal Now, Respond Later</h3>
            <p>
              When a user sends a Signal that implies a delayed response—like
              “Will reply soon” or “Busy right now”—the conversation is
              automatically sorted into the Replying Soon filter. This creates a
              lightweight reminder system, helping users keep track of threads
              that need follow-up without overwhelming their main inbox.

              Familiar Feel, Smarter Signals
            </h3>
            <p>
              Inspired by Apple’s Focus mode, this screen lets users create
              custom Signals that automatically display on their lock screen.
              With full control over timing, visibility, and recipients, users
              can schedule when a Signal—like “Brb” or “Busy until 8 PM”—is
              shown and to whom. It blends seamlessly into existing iOS patterns
              while introducing a personalized layer of social context that
              adapts to real-life rhythms.

                  Small UX tweaks, like contextual signals, can significantly
                  ease emotional tension in everyday interactions—bridging the
                  gap between intention and perception.

                <p>
                  Features that take less than two seconds to use can reshape
                  communication norms, proving that convenience and empathy
                  aren’t mutually exclusive.

                  Giving people control over how they’re perceived—without
                  forcing full replies—fosters trust and lowers anxiety in
                  digital spaces.

                This project challenged me to think deeply about the nuances of
                digital communication and the importance of designing for
                empathy. I'm excited to bring these lessons into future work!
